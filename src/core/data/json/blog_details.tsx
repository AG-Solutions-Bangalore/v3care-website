    title: 'Five Health Benefits of a Clean Home That Will Surprise You',
    description: [
      "Health Benefit #1: Keeping Your Bedroom Clean May Lead to Better Sleep",
      "Have a hard time catching those beloved zzz's? You aren't alone.",
      "A recent study by the National Sleep Foundation showed that 45 percent of Americans experience poor sleep. It's a wonder, with our constant on-the-go lifestyles, that we all don't fall into bed and conk out until morning—but that isn't the case.",
      "The truth is, our minds are full, and of course we think of all the things left undone as we try to fall asleep, including all of the mess around us in our bedrooms.",
      "The National Sleep Foundation also ran a survey that clearly showed those with clean sheets and clean rooms had an easier time sleeping. Clean house, clean mind!",
      "Health Benefit #2: A Clean, Clutter-free Space Can Improve Your Mental Health",
      "When every surface is covered in clutter, laundry is in an unknown state—clean? dirty?—kids' school papers, dirty cups and who even knows what lies beneath it all along with dust, crusted spills, pet hair….",
      "It's overwhelming and can actually contribute to stress, anxiety, and depression. While over time, parts of our brain shut off the mess and we become 'clutter blind,' other parts of our brain become overwhelmed. All it sees is the untidy mess, the unfinished piles, leaving a part of your brain ticking away as it thinks about that unfinished business. A Princeton University study concluded that clutter can actually overwhelm the visual cortex, making it more difficult to process the task at hand.",
      "That wasn't the only study showing the effects of clutter on mental health. Many psychology studies have been performed that show an uncluttered, clean space can help us focus better and feel calmer, less depressed and less anxious in general.",
      "Health Benefit #3: A Clean Home Can Lead to Healthier Food Choices",
      "It's been well established that cluttered, dirty and even off-smelling spaces make us feel anxious and stressed. And it's no secret that many of us tend to make poor food choices when we are stressed.",
      "When you look at it that way, it's easy to see the reverse, that a clean and tidy home may lead you to better eating habits and a generally healthier lifestyle. Science backs up this thinking. A 2010 study published in the journal Psychological Science showed that people in a more orderly, clean environment made smarter, healthier snacking choices than those attempting to work in more cluttered, messy spaces.",
      "A messy, grungy kitchen is no fun to cook or eat in, either, so those who have cleaner, neater kitchens may be more likely to make healthier food at home, rather than avoid their kitchens altogether and go out to eat. This may not seem like a big deal, but it does add up quickly. The average fast-food meal weighs in at about 1,800 calories, whereas a home-cooked dinner comes in at about 550.",
      "Health Benefit #4: A Clean Home Can Ease Seasonal Allergy Symptoms",
      "Whether you suffer primarily from seasonal outdoor allergies to pollen and molds or mainly what's considered 'indoor' allergies like dust, dust mites, pet dander, and hair, keeping a clean home can greatly reduce your symptoms. Outdoor allergens like pollen and mold can be tracked in on feet and clothing, truly 'bringing the outdoors in.' If left to accumulate, dust, animal hair, and other allergens can wreak havoc on your nose, eyes, and sinuses, leaving you feeling foggy, itchy and red-eyed.",
      "Keeping the home clean, including regular vacuuming with a high-powered, HEPA filter vacuum and paying special attention to any areas that might be prone to mold growth, specifically in the bathroom; keeping airborne dust to a minimum by dusting with a moist cloth (as opposed to a dry cloth, which will simply send dust flying around); regularly changing bed sheets; and cleaning window dressings can greatly reduce your allergy symptoms.",
      "Health Benefit #5: A Consistently Clean and Tidy Home Saves Money",
      "Staying on top of regular cleaning tasks and keeping extraneous clutter to a minimum in your home can truly save you money in several ways.",
      "First off, when you keep your home clean regularly, you will have less of a need for more expensive, extra-strength cleaning products, as the dirt and grime aren't given an opportunity to get built up to the point that would require extra cleaning power.",
      "Secondly, surfaces are more likely to become damaged if they are coated with dirt and grime. Dirt on wood or tile flooring acts like sandpaper when people walk on it, scratching and dulling the finish, making it look worn before it should. Soap and hard water deposits can damage bathroom finishes. Keeping surfaces like floors, counters and bathroom fixtures clean will help them stay looking nice for longer.",
      "Third, keeping appliances clean will help them work more efficiently and last longer, saving you thousands.",
      "Keeping clutter at bay can save money as well. How many times have you bought a new item because you couldn't find one in your home, only for it to resurface a few days later, somewhere it definitely didn't belong?"

      "10 House Cleaning Tips Using Baking Soda",
      "1. Add baking soda to the bottom of your kitchen garbage, and add more after you put a new bag in to eliminate the smell.",
      "2. To get rid of scuff marks and/or grease spills on the floor, sprinkle with baking soda and then wipe with a warm, damp cloth. This tip is safe for no-wax floors.",
      "3. For burnt-on food in the bottom of pots, sprinkle with baking soda, then add hot water. Let soak overnight; the dried on food will come loose much more easily.",
      "4. To remove stubborn stains from most surfaces, use a baking soda paste (3 parts baking soda, one part water). Apply, let stand, then scrub or wipe clean.",
      "5. To avoid clogged drains, pour 1/4 cup baking soda down weekly. Rinse through with hot water.",
      "6. To help decrease the chance of spills remaining in the carpet and starting to smell. After cleaning a spill as you would normally, sprinkle with baking soda and vacuum after a few minutes.",
      "7. Clean children's toys with 1/4 cup baking soda in 1 quart warm water. Toys can either be soaked in this cleaning mixture or wiped with a dampened cloth. Rinse with water.",
      "8. Replace half of your usual amount of laundry detergent with baking soda to keep clothing fresh.",
      "9. With the typical bleach amount add 1/2 cup of baking soda to your laundry to increase the bleach's effectiveness.",
      "10. Add a little bit of baking soda every day to your laundry hamper to keep the hamper from smelling between emptyings."

      "Part of gifting house cleaning service is really about time and how we spend or want to spend our time. Time is precious and once lost can never again be found.",

    title: 'Your Winter Cleaning Checklist',
    description: [
      "Check your furnace system.",
      "Each winter, you should check your furnace system and replace its filters. It is also a good idea to have your vents and air ducts cleaned. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that people change their HVAC filters at least every month and more often when the system is under heavy use. Changing the filters and having the ducts and vents cleaned help to ensure that your system will run more efficiently and help to prevent dust and allergens from building up inside of your home.",
      "Clear out the clutter.",
      "If clutter has collected inside of your home, now is the time to clear it out. It will be much easier for you to keep your home neat and clean if you are not overwhelmed by clutter. Getting rid of clutter also helps to make room for gifts you will receive during the holidays. Some tips to help you declutter include the following:",
      "- If you have not used it for one year, donate it.",
      "- Use three boxes labeled keep, donate, and throw away.",
      "- Start small before building up to tackle larger projects.",
      "- Work together with a friend or family member to declutter more quickly.",
      "- Go through your closet and dresser to get rid of clothes that no longer fit.",
      "- Donate toys your children have outgrown.",
      "Have your dryer vents professionally cleaned.",
      "Even with a lint trap, lint can accumulate in your dryer's hoses and its back. Lint build-up can create a fire hazard, making it important to have it cleaned at least once per year. Lint buildup also makes your dryer work less efficiently, so cleaning it out can help to reduce your energy bills.",
      "Clean your chimney.",
      "If you have a fireplace in your home, it is critical for you to ensure that your chimney is properly maintained. Buildup in your chimney can cause a fire. It can also reduce the air quality in your home. The best way to ensure your chimney is properly cleaned and maintained is to get the help of a professional.",
      "Deep clean your kitchen and kitchen appliances.",
      "Most people do a lot more cooking during the winter months. This makes it important for you to clean your kitchen appliances, including your oven, stove, refrigerator, and freezer. Do not forget to clean behind your appliances, too. While you are at it, it is a good time to dust your cabinets and drawers and clean out your refrigerator and freezer. Check the food on your shelves to get rid of anything that is expired, and clean the grease and food buildup on your vent hood and backsplashes. Make sure to give the kitchen floors a thorough cleaning so that you will be left with a sparkling-clean kitchen your whole family can enjoy.",
      "Clean your curtains, carpets, and furniture.",
      "Keeping your carpets, furniture, and curtains clean during the winter can greatly enhance the enjoyability of your home's indoor space. Pet hair, smells, and stains can build up in carpets, making it important to clean them regularly. Dust can settle on curtains, and dirt particles can settle into the crevices of your furniture. At the same time, winter brings snow and mud that people can track into your home on their shoes. Thoroughly clean your carpets, furniture, and curtains to reduce dirt buildup and improve the air quality of your home.",
      "Wash your windows.",
      "Winter weather makes smears and dirt on glass more noticeable. You will also want to allow more natural light into your home during the day, and keeping the windows clean and smear-free can help to brighten your home and combat feeling down when it is cold outside. Make sure to clean the sills and glass, and don't forget to dust your blinds."

    description: [
      "Floor polishing might seem like a mundane task, something you do just to make your floors look shiny and new. But there are many hidden benefits of floor polishing that you may not know about. From making your floors last longer to improving indoor air quality, floor polishing can have a big impact on your home and your life. Here are five unexpected benefits of Floor Polishing Melbourne.",
      "What is floor polishing?",
      "Floor Polishing is a process that can be used to revitalize and protect your flooring. It can improve the appearance of your floors and increase their lifespan by sealing the surface and protecting it from scratches, dirt, and moisture. Floor polishing can also reduce slips and falls, making your home or office safer for everyone.",
      "The benefits of floor polishing",
      "Floor polishing provides a number of benefits that are not commonly known. Here are five of the most unexpected benefits of floor polishing:",
      "1. Floor polishing reduces slips and falls. A polished floor provides more traction than an unpolished floor, making it less likely for someone to slip and fall.",
      "2. Floor polishing increases floor durability. A polished floor is less likely to show scratches and scuffs, making it last longer.",
      "3. Floor polishing improves air quality. A polished floor traps dust and other particles, preventing them from spreading through the air.",
      "4. Floor polishing brightens the appearance of your flooring. A polished floor reflects light better than an unpolished floor, making it look brighter and cleaner.",
      "5. Floor polishing increases the resale value of your home. A well-polished floor adds instant visual appeal and shows that the home has been well-maintained.",
      "How often should you polish your floors?",
      "You should polish your floor every 3 to 6 months, depending on how often it's used and how much traffic it sees. A high-traffic area may need to be polished more often, while a room that's rarely used can go longer without treatment.",
      "Regular polishing will protect your floor from spills and dirt accumulation and can also help to disguise any scratches or blemishes that may have appeared over time. So if you're looking for an easy way to keep your floor looking its best, give wood floor polishing a try!"

    description: [
      "Don't be afraid — cleaning a refrigerator (and keeping it clean) isn't a herculean task if you follow these tips:",
      "1. Create a homemade all-purpose cleaner by combining the following in a gallon of hot water: 1 cup clear ammonia, ½-cup vinegar and ¼-cup baking soda. Pour into a spray bottle, or use from a bowl with a sponge. This no-rinse formula is a degreaser that prevents mold and mildew. Wipe down the entire refrigerator with this solution, including the drawers and shelves.",
      "2. To prevent grease and odor buildup on top of the refrigerator after you've cleaned it, just buff some paste wax into the surface.",
      "3. Use toothpaste to remove tough stains. It contains a gentle abrasive and has a pleasant odor.",
      "4. To get those dust bunnies out from under the refrigerator, remove the grill and run a yardstick covered with a pair of pantyhose underneath. Also check the pan of water under the unit, since it can hold unpleasant-smelling water.",
      "5. To combat household odors, fill a clean old sock with activated charcoal from an aquarium store, tie a knot in the top and place it in the back of the refrigerator. This will last a month or two, depending on the size of your refrigerator and how heavily you use it.",
      "6. For a faster fix for odors, sprinkle vanilla extract on some cotton balls, place in a shallow dish and put in the refrigerator. Orange extract also works.",
      "7. Eliminate lingering odors in your vegetable bins by putting a crumpled piece of a brown paper grocery bag inside and leaving it for 48 hours. The paper will absorb the odor.",
      "8. Check for adequate tightness of the insulating seam around the door by placing a lighted flashlight inside the refrigerator and closing the door. Turn off the lights in the room (this should be done at night) and see if any light escapes from the seams. This will help you pinpoint any leaks.",
      "9. If you don't keep your refrigerator full, fill a large bottle (at least a gallon) with water and leave it in the refrigerator. It helps keep the refrigerator cool and running efficiently.",
      "10. Keep your refrigerator at 37 degrees."

    title: 'How to Choose Paint Colors for Your Entire House',
    description: [
      "STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR SHADE FIRST",
      "The first thing you will want to do when deciding what color you want to paint the exterior of your home is to choose the shade of a color first. When I say 'shade', I mean do you want a light, mid-tone or dark color on the body of your home? At this point, you don't have to consider anything else except to make a decision if you want a light or white color, a mid-tone or medium shade, or do you want a dark color.",
      "For most of you, choosing a shade is an instant easy decision and you immediately know that you want a light or dark colored home. However, some of you may not be sure and are open to any shade and need a little help making that decision. It will help if you search Pinterest for exterior homes for inspiration to determine what shade would look best for your home. For example, if you have a ranch style home, search 'ranch style home exteriors' in Pinterest search to see all the different color options to inspire you.",
      "STEP 2: CONSIDER YOUR ROOF COLOR",
      "Before you can go much further in your color decision-making, you will need to consider the color of your roof. If you have a black or neutral gray, you don't have to worry as much about color clashing. Unfortunately, I have a dark brown roof with slight red undertones, so colors like shades of green or blues wouldn't work for me and would clash. For those of you that have a roof with red, tan, green or blue gray undertones in your shingles, you will for sure need to factor in your roof color as you choose your exterior paint color palette.",
      "If you have a dark brown roof with shingles that have a red undertone, you will want to stick with a true neutral main body color for your home to play it safe. If you have shingles with green or blue gray undertones, you have a little more leeway and you will prevent color clashing if you choose a color that's either neutral or has a slight hint of your shingle color in it to blend and compliment and not fight. If you have a black roof, you can pretty much do anything.",
      "If you have stone or brick on your home, you will need to also factor in any strong undertones found in your brick or stone. If your home is full brick and you just need to choose a trim color, I will match either the lightest, mid-tone or darkest color found in the stone/brick and use that as a trim color.",
      "If your home is not full brick/stone and is either half stone/brick or you simply have brick/stone accents, you have a lot more wiggle room with color choices for the exterior body color of your home. As long as your body color has a very slight hint of the brick/stone undertone color, you shouldn't have any clashing issues. For example, if your brick has a warm undertone and you want to go gray on your home body color, choose a light warm gray instead of a cool gray. That way, the warmth in the gray is what will tie/blend the new body color to the brick.",
      "STEP 3: FACTOR IN LIGHT",
      "Next, after you have considered your roof color and decided on the shade, you will need to factor in the impact light has on exterior paint colors, which is unlike choosing colors for interiors. I'm going to save you a lot of time by telling you that daylight/sunlight will drastically turn your exterior color cool/blue, which is what happens to a paint color when there is an abundance of light. As crazy as this may sound, you will need to go at least 2-3 times warmer on your exterior color to get to a balanced color that won't lean cool or blue. Let me show you what I mean.",
      "When it came time to paint the exterior of our pool house outdoor kitchen, I had to choose a color that was actually about 3 times warmer than what I wanted in my desired end color. I wanted an end color that looked like Sherwin Williams 'On the Rocks' but because of the abundance of light that impacts exterior paint colors, I had to choose a color that was 3 times warmer to offset the color from going blue or cool.",
      "STEP 4: FINDING EXTERIOR COLOR INSPIRATION",
      "As you narrow your shade down, factor in roof color and know that you'll need to go warmer because of the abundance of exterior light, next you will need to decide on an actual color for the exterior body of your home. It helps to look for similar home styles to get a feel for the possibilities. I have a Pinterest board here that is all exterior paint colors on homes that can really help you to visualize a color."

    description: [
      "Kitchen sinks are among the most used items in your household. It's no wonder, then, that they can also be the dirtiest. Left unclean too long, the bacteria that manifest in the sink can lead to life-threatening illnesses. However, by effectively incorporating non-harmful cleaning products like baking soda, lemon juice, vinegar, and old-fashioned elbow grease, your kitchen sink, whether it's stainless steel or the more stubborn porcelain, won't stand a chance. A fresh and clean sink is on the way.",
      "Check your nightstand(s) and toss or recycle anything you don't need, such as old receipts, used tissues and empty water bottles. There should be nothing in it as you begin scrubbing your sink. Remember to clean items that you keep in or around your sink, too. Move your sponge holder and drain stopper to get a more thorough clean.",
      "Wash down the entire surface area of your sink. Use a gentle soap, soft cloth, and warm water to clean the faucets, drain, and outer rim. Do this every time you use the sink, which includes after preparing meals or washing dishes.",
      "Run hot tap water into the drain. This will help eliminate bad odor and soften any gooey materials that may threaten to clog the drain. Alternatively, boil a pot of water and pour that down, as it will help loosen any caked-on gunk in your drain. Be sure to wet down the entire sink through this process. Do this several times a week.",
      "Create a blend of baking soda and lemon juice for the surface. Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda to 1/4 cup of lemon juice and pour it over the surface of your sink. Let this mixture stand for approximately 10 minutes before rinsing it away with hot water. Do this to your sink at least once a week. Baking soda is a natural cleaning agent that breaks down dirt and grease, so feel free to sprinkle it on cracks and harder-to-hit places, such as around the faucet and handles, and scrub at it with a toothbrush.",
      "Create a larger blend of baking soda and lemon juice for the drain. Mix 1/2 cup of baking soda with 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Pour this directly into the drain, and follow it with 1/2 cup of white vinegar. Cover it and wait 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, boil some hot water and pour it in. The reaction of the cleaning products will help break up gunk and sanitize the drain, and the hot water will rinse it before it forms again.",
      "Use flour to polish the sink. Completely dry the sink with a towel. Any wetness left over will become like a paste when mixed with the flour. Sprinkle flour around the sink. Using a new, clean towel, slowly buff around the stainless steel in circular motions (the way you might wax a car). Remove the excess flour and throw it away.",
      "1/4 cup of flour works great, but it isn't essential that you measure it.",
      "Repeat this process as you see fit. It may take a few times before it glistens."

    description: [
      "When was the last time you bothered to look at your home chimney? When was the last time you spent your time to get the chimney cleaned? There is no wonder in the fact that we have not considered chimney cleaning as a part of homemaking. Today many of the homeowners are keen on keeping their house clean and do not mind in spending time and money on it, however, chimney cleaning is disdained due to lack of awareness about its importance and benefits. In this article, let us know about the benefits of chimney cleaning and the reasons to keep it clean.",
      "National Fire Protection Association recommends us to clean our chimney and get it inspected by professionals at least once in a year. Cleaning is always a good practice and there are many wise reasons to clean and inspect your chimney but here are top three reasons to chimney cleaning that you should consider on a serious note.",
      "To forbid the Chimney fire",
      "A chimney fire is quite dangerous with loud popping sounds and dense smoke, however, it isn't dramatic every time to alert you. It burns at a slower pace with higher temperature and has the capacity to ignite things at home. The flames from the chimney can spread into the walls and roof of your home to cause a massive havoc and devastation. The most commonly observed cause for chimney fire is the accumulation of dirt and with time, chimneys will become clogged with creosote. Creosote is a tar-like substance which is a by-product of burning wood that builds up due to restricted air supply in the chimney. Avert the chimney fire by cleaning and maintaining the chimney on a regular basis.",
      "To save your health",
      "Dirt filled and blocked chimney release the dangerous carbon monoxide (CO) gas which at low levels can cause a headache, dizziness, nausea, and dementia. Inhaling of CO is hazardous to health and can eventually lead to death. One more reason to have your chimney examined and swept before use.",
      "To avoid chimney smoke entering your house",
      "Improper maintenance of chimney will result in the accumulation of soot around the chimney flue. This makes it difficult for the flue to draw the smoke upwards instead it may end up entering your house. The soot leaves a black film around the fireplace and soil the furniture or other household items placed nearby. In the worst case, the smoke can create a black stain around the chimney making it hard to clean.",
      "Chimney cleaning becomes important and ignoring it for a longer period of time can welcome some serious problems. Please ensure to be cautious and take a professional help for your regular chimney cleaning and maintenance."
